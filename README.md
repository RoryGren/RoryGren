- 👋 Hi, I’m @RoryGren
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and web apps. I am a self-taught web developer/designer using html, css, js, php and mysql, all learned using old friends like Google, StackOverflow, Free Code Camp, Udemy and the like. I have been in the game for many years and cannot stop learning!
- 🌱 I have fiddled with nodejs and am currently learning Angular.
- 💞️ I have built small, static websites, WP-based websites, CRM systems, online training systems for previous employers and clubs or associations I have had connections with.
